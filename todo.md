5. extract results into folder in a presentable format


-- TODO LIST 
1. Update Returns and Scores file to a fixed format, maybe build function in order to call returns and scores in a script rather than via different scripts (done, rest to follow)
    - after discussing with David, packaging and functions is recommended as it will be graded with a minor weight 
    - use various index as a main branch, and other regional indexes as a second branch
    - i.e. MSCI for World trends, (STOXX 500 for EU, FTSE350 for UK), and then dive to industry layer etc. (wrangle by industry, stack)
    - Regression and Statistical methods to check with David in T2 Week 1

2. Focal points in timeline, enter results into descriptive statistics and dissertation
3. Regression should wait until next meeting with David
