1. extract past 20 years returns for NASDAQ companies
2. extract past 20 years ESG scores for the aforementioned companies
3. set them into dataframe 

    - 1, 2 and 3 are done
        - total assets (actual) missing before 2012?
        - might be under different name
        
    - extracted for NASDAQ only, SNP500 to follow up
        - extracted NASDAQ, SNP500, DJI (Dow sample size too small)
        - david advised to extract EURO STOXX 600, FTSE 350 as well for cross-comparison
        - maybe cross-compare across BBG, Morningstar Sustainalytics?

    - to run further analysis in order to run on select scope on companies in hope for persistency throughout sample set
    - check .isin function in pandas?
    
4. run regression and correlation analysis

5. extract results into folder in a presentable format
